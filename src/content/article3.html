                In a video on Instagram this week, Mark Zuckerberg confessed to controlling the stolen data of billions
                of people and said he owed it all to an organisation called Spectre.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                The video was of course faked, and on this week's Tech Tent we examine the dilemma it posed for
                Instagram's owner Facebook.

                A few weeks ago, the social media giant came under fire for allowing a doctored video of the US House
                Speaker Nancy Pelosi to remain up.<br/>

                So how would it react when the faked video of its founder emerged?<br/>

                The video featured the real Mark Zuckerberg, but the voice and the words emerging from his mouth were
                not his.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                It was the work of two artists, Daniel Howe and a man going by the name of Bill Posters, and was part of
                an installation on show in Sheffield this week.<br/>

                When we spoke to Bill Posters he told us that the video had been planned long before the row over
                Facebook's treatment of Nancy Pelosi.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                The aim was to throw a light on Facebook's business model, which involved using behavioural psychology
                to persuade people to share intimate details of their lives so that they could be targeted with
                advertising.<br/>
                "We're shining the light on Facebook and Zuckerberg himself to ask what happens now when it's your
                privacy and your data that's been used in obscure or unintended ways" he said.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                Unsurprisingly, Facebook did not remove the video, It said it followed the same policy as with the Nancy
                Pelosi video and other misinformation on its services - let third party fact-checkers determine whether
                it was fake, and then make it less visible in users' feeds rather than taking it down.
