            <p class="article__paragraph">
                Huawei has delayed the launch of the Mate X folding handset until September, having originally planned
                to launch it this summer.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                The firm said it wanted to conduct extra tests following screen problems reported by early reviewers of
                Samsung's Galaxy Fold.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                Both firms had unveiled the devices in February but Huawei said it now wanted to be "cautious".
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                Samsung currently has no release date for the Fold.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                Huawei confirmed to the BBC that the Mate X is expected to launch in September 2019.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                "We don't want to launch a product to destroy our reputation," it told CNBC.
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                "There is little doubt Huawei will have learned lessons from Samsung's problems and - given the extra
                scrutiny the Mate X will get as a result - Huawei is well advised to ensure it has every eventuality
                covered."
            </p>
            <p class="article__paragraph">
                Huawei has also scrapped a new laptop launch this week because of its current position on a US trade
                blacklist.
