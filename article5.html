                <p class="article__paragraph">
                    "I see Amazon as a technology company that just happened to do retail," begins Werner Vogels,
                    Amazon's chief technology officer.<br /> Its recent Re:Mars event in Las Vegas demonstrated clearly
                    - through presentations about machine-learning, robotics and space - that the firm is going through
                    a transition phase that, if successful, will redefine its relationship with the public.
                </p>
                <p class="article__paragraph"> Amazon's incredible, sophisticated systems are no longer being used just to serve up good deals,
                    fast delivery times, or cheap web storage. Its big data capabilities are now the tool of police
                    forces, and maybe soon the military. In the corporate world, Amazon is positioning itself to be the
                    “brains” behind just about everything.

                <h2 class="article__section-header"> Next major phase</h2>
                <p class="article__paragraph">
                    Amazon, of course, knows this. Which is why, for an entire week earlier this month, the firm,
                    typically reluctant to engage too deeply with the press, did so with enthusiasm: dinners,
                    interviews, and remarkably frank discussions about its ambitions.
                </p>
                <p class="article__paragraph">
                    As a result, Amazon provides the infrastructure backbone for major firms such as AirBnB and Netflix,
                    as well as more than one million other clients who collectively give Amazon "control" of large
                    swathes of the web. When AWS suffered a technical glitch in 2017, tech site Gizmodo said it simply
                    "destroyed the internet". There are competing major cloud platforms - from Microsoft and Google -
                    but AWS is on top
                </p>
                <p class="article__paragraph">
                    Mr Vogels wants to offer companies access to technologies they could not create themselves, such as
                    Textract (“automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents”) or Lex, which uses the same
                    technology as the Alexa voice assistant to turn voice recordings into text.

                <h2 class="article__section-header"> ‘Not my decision’</h2>
                <p class="article__paragraph">
                    Among the tools it is offering, Amazon’s image recognition product is the most controversial. For a
                    per-minute fee of a few pence, Amazon Rekognition can scan video footage and, for example, pick up
                    people’s faces that can then be checked against a client’s database.
                </p>
                <p class="article__paragraph">
                    Civil rights groups have called it “perhaps the most dangerous surveillance technology ever
                    developed”, and called for Amazon to stop selling it to government agencies, particularly police
                    forces. City supervisors in San Francisco banned its use, saying the software is not only intrusive,
                    but biased - it’s better at recognising white people than black and Asian people.
                </p>
                <p class="article__paragraph">
                    Mr Vogels doesn’t feel it's Amazon’s responsibility to make sure Rekognition is used accurately or
                    ethically.“That’s not my decision to make,” he tells me.<br />
                    “This technology is being used for good in many places. It’s in society’s direction to actually
                    decide which technology is applicable under which conditions.
